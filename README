Lobbyist Disclosure Scrapper and Lookup

This go program retrieves the latest current year lobby disclosure filings from House.gov.
User url at http://disclosures.house.gov/ utimately leads to http://disclosures.house.gov/ld/LDDownload.aspx?KeepThis=true to download filings in xml format. 
Using the standard interface, you cannot download more than 2000 records at a time. I actually tried calling them to ask about an alternative electronic method of retrieval, but alas that did not work.

The house.gov site uses an input element with method of POST to an asp page to serve the archive files. The site also runs on ASP which has ViewState and EventValidation enforced to prevent CSRF. ViewStateand EventValidation makes programmatic POST requests more complicated as we need to have valid ViewState and EventValidation values in order to send a valid POST request. 

This Go program retrieves a response from the ASP server with a GET request. After parsing the hidden ViewState and EventValidation input values, we are able to construct a valid POST request which the ASP server replies back with a file stream. We write the file stream to a defined file.  

XML files are then parsed into structs and held in memory for fast retrieval.

Run with go run api.go scrape.go
